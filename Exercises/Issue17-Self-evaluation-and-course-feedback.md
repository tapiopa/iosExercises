# Issue17 - Exercise: Self Evaluation and course feedback

<b>This exercise is mandatory to do, to pass the course.</b>

In this exercise you don't need to write any code, just write your self evaluation
and course feedback to this issue comments in your own repository (like you have 
commented your normal exercises before that one). 

You can use following topics in your course feedback:
* How you feel the content of the course (overall)?
* How you feel the course web site and materials in Labranet GitLab?
* Is the material suitable for virtual study? If not what should be improved?
* How about workload (low, ok, too much)?
* How about evaluation (exercises and research assignment)?
* Give a rating number from 1-5 (5 == excellent)
* Something else you want to say...

Remember analyse your own self evaluation too. How you have learned iOS 
Application Development, and so on...

Note!

Remember move this exercise issue from <b>Doing</b> to <b>In review</b> list in 
Issues Boards.
