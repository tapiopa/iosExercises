## Items of Assessment
### 1. Exercises
Exercises teaches the basics of the iOS Application Development with Swift programming language. 

Students needs to download (and import back to GitLab using his/her own account) <a href="https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/TTOW0640/iOS-Application-Development/blob/master/iOS-Exercises.tar.gz" target="_blank">iOS-Exercises</a> 
repository to start doing their exercises. All needed information about each exercise are given inside exercises repository. Exercises are described as an issues inside iOS Exercises repository. 

Student need to use exercise repository Issues Boards and drag an exercise issue from 
<b>Backlog</b> to <b>Doing</b> section when student start's working with an exercise. 
Student need to remember move an issue to <b>In Review</b> section in Issues Boards when student has 
completed exercise and pushed an exercise work back into his/her iOS Exercise repository at JAMK GitLab. 
This way teacher knows that student has finished an exercise/issue and teacher can start an exercise evaluation. 
Teacher will move an issue to the <b>Closed</b> section in a Issues Boards when exercise is approved. 
Teacher is monitoring your learning process all the time!

So don't just create exercises one after another and then push all exercises 
back to GitLab, push your modifications after you have finished one of the exercises. 

Student needs to send his/her name, studentID and repository url to teacher via email immediately after student has imported iOS-Exercises repository 
back using his/her own account (repository name and path is then available).

Note that exercise/issue 17: Self evaluation and course feedback, is mandatory to do.

#### How to start working with iOS-Exercise repository
There is a few important steps to follow how to work with iOS-Exercises repository. First you need to download and import repository back to using
your own account. This way you will get all the already defined exercises to your own repository and Issues Boards which is the tool how the teacher
can follow and evaluate your work. You need to modify your imported repository a little to get teacher account included inside it. After that you need
to clone repository to your local machine to start working/doing exercises. After you have finished one of the exercises, you need to use Git and add
added/modified files to Git version control. Finally you need to push your added/modified files/projects back to your repository at Labranet GitLab. You
need to move exercise issue from Doing to In review when you have finished one of your exercises (and pushed your project to GitLab). Teacher will evaluate
your work and move issue from In review to Closed list. All of this is described in following videos.

#### Evaluation
Exercises gives 60% of course evaluation (0-3 number). Student need to todo at least 50% of exercises to pass course.

| Exercises done  | Number |
| - | - |
| >= 90% | 3 |
| >= 70% | 2 |
| >= 50% | 1 |
| < 50% | 0 |

### 2. Research assignment (optional)
Students deepen their knowledge by selecting one iOS-related technology that has 
not been discussed in the course (or it can be, student need to go much more deeper level on it) and 
implement a research assignment on the topic in small groups. 
The research assignment includes familiarization with the selected 
technology and implementation of a mobile demonstration/application. The results of the 
research assignments are documented and presented in a seminar or with a recorded video if student 
is participating in virtual studies. For video recording, you can use e.g. 
<a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a>. 
For storing, you can use e.g. YouTube or upload the video here in GitLab.

Research assignments are implemented by 1-3 person groups, bigger groups need approvement from teacher. 
Remember send your group's subject proposal to course lecturer in time. It is always a good idea to 
discuss about your topic with lecturer in advance. 

Student will return all the project files (docs, presentations, images, videos and source codes) to GitLab using iOS-Research repository. 
All needed information about how to work and return research assigment are given inside that repository.

Students need to download (and import back to GitLab using his/her own account) <a href="https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/TTOW0640/iOS-Application-Development/blob/master/iOS-Research.tar.gz" target="_blank">iOS-Research</a> repository to start doing their research. 
All needed information about research assignment are given inside research assignment repository. 

Student needs to send all group member names, studentIDs, subject proposal and repository URL to teacher via email.

Research assignment can continue to TTOW0630 Mobile Project course where students deepens his/her knowledge on a selected mobile technology, designs and implements a mobile application in a small group. The student creates a plan on mobile application including the objectives of the application, use cases, mockups (a wireframe model), object and data model plans, possible data connections to external data storages and schedules weekly objectives as tasks. The project also results in a final report and a seminar presentation.  

#### How to start working with iOS-Research repository
You will work with iOS-Research repository the same way as you are working with iOS-Exercises.<br/>
1. Download and import repository
2. Modify settings to add teacher as a reporter
3. Clone repository to your local machine
4. Look what issues/tasks there are and start doing
5. When a task is ready, push it back and move issue to In review
6. Continue work with other issues

#### Evaluation
Research assignment gives 40% of course evaluation (0-2 number). Evaluation contains presentation 
(voice, ppt and other materials) 50% and programming (own made demo etc...) 50%. The most 
important outcome is that seminar audience will get a good picture to the shown 
technology and they are able to start explore it more easily. 

Note: Don't use already made materials, make your own research!

## Course evaluation example
Student has done 30% of course exercises and not research assignment. Course number will be: 0.<br/>
Student has done 61% of course exercises and not research assignment. Course number will be: 1.<br/>
Student has done 88% of course exercises and not research assignment. Course number will be: 2.<br/>
Student has done 91% of course exercises and not research assignment. Course number will be: 3.<br/>
<br/>
Student has done 45% of course exercises, presentation number 2 and programming number 5.<br/>
Course number will be: 0, because below 50% of the course exercises has been done.<br/>
<br/>
Student has done 75% of course exercises, presentation number 3 and programming number 5.<br/>
Course number will be: 2 + (3*0.5 + 5*0.5)*0.4 = 2 + 4*0.4 = 2 + 1.6 = 3.6 => 4.
